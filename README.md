# LINQ Tutorial

Welcome to the LINQ Tutorial!

This tutorial consists of a bunch of excercises. Yout can start an excercise by merging the excercise branch to your local branch.

## Start here
To start a new solution, open a new branch with:
```
git checkout -b 'my-solution'
```
To list the git branches with the excercises run:
```
git branch | grep excercise-
```
To list the git branches with the solutions run:
```
git branch | grep answer-
```
Let's start with the first excercise by running:
```
git merge excercise-general-001
```
Whenever the command `dotnet test` passes, you can consider the excercise passed and merge the next excercise.

The list of assignments will be here at the end of the README.md file.

## ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! You made it to the first excercise! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

### excercise-general-001
In this excercise you will need to make a test project. Do it by running the command:
```
dotnet new sln -n LinqTutorial &&
  dotnet new mstest -o LinqTutorial.Tests &&
  dotnet sln LinqTutorial.sln add LinqTutorial.Tests/
```

### excercise-enumerables-001
Your task is to implement `MyEnumerable` that is an implementor of `IEnumerable<int>`. It has a static method that is almost the same as `Enumerable.Range`, but `Enumerable.Range` takes two parameters: the start int, and the number of items to generate, but `MyEnumerable.Range` takes a start int and an end in exclusive.

### excercise-enumerables-002
Your task is to implement `IEnumerable.MySelect` extension method. You will need to return an instance of `MySelectEnumerable` that is a wrapper enumerable; it takes an `IEnumerable<TSource>` and a `Func<TSource, TResult>` and when the current element is requested it returns the current element of the `IEnumerable<TSource>` with the `Func<TSource, TResult>` applied, therefore a `TResult` instance.


Check your solution with running the following command (after making sure its safe of course). It will also print what to do for the next excercise:
```
chmod 755 check.sh && ./check.sh
```
