# LINQ Tutorial

Welcome to the LINQ Tutorial!

This tutorial consists of a bunch of excercises. Yout can start an excercise by merging the excercise branch to your local branch.

## Start here
To start a new solution, open a new branch with:
```
git checkout -b 'my-solution'
```
To list the git branches with the excercises run:
```
git branch | grep excercise-
```
To list the git branches with the solutions run:
```
git branch | grep solution-of-
```
Let's start with the first excercise by running:
```
git merge excercise-general-001
```
Whenever the command `dotnet test` passes, you can consider the excercise passed and merge the next excercise.

The list of assignments will be here at the end of the README.md file.
