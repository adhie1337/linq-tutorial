# LINQ Tutorial

Welcome to the LINQ Tutorial!

This tutorial consists of a bunch of excercises. Yout can start an excercise by merging the excercise branch to your local branch.

## Start here
To start a new solution, open a new branch with:
```
git checkout -b 'my-solution'
```
To list the git branches with the excercises run:
```
git branch | grep excercise-
```
To list the git branches with the solutions run:
```
git branch | grep answer-
```
Let's start with the first excercise by running:
```
git merge excercise-general-001
```
Whenever the command `dotnet test` passes, you can consider the excercise passed and merge the next excercise.

The list of assignments will be here at the end of the README.md file.

## ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! You made it to the first excercise! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

### excercise-general-001
In this excercise you will need to make a test project. Do it by running the command:
```
dotnet new sln -n LinqTutorial &&
  dotnet new mstest -o LinqTutorial.Tests &&
  dotnet sln LinqTutorial.sln add LinqTutorial.Tests/ &&
  sed -i '' 's/\r$//' LinqTutorial.Tests/LinqTutorial.Tests.csproj LinqTutorial.Tests/UnitTest1.cs LinqTutorial.sln
```


## To check the solution You have:
Check your solution with running the following command (after making sure its safe of course). It will also print what to do for the next excercise:
```
chmod 755 check.sh && ./check.sh
```
