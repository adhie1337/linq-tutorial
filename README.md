# LINQ Tutorial

Welcome to the LINQ Tutorial!

This tutorial consists of a bunch of excercises. Yout can start an excercise by merging the excercise branch to your local branch.

## Start here
To start a new solution, open a new branch with:
```
git checkout -b 'my-solution'
```
To list the git branches with the excercises run:
```
git branch | grep excercise-
```
To list the git branches with the solutions run:
```
git branch | grep answer-
```
Let's start with the first excercise by running:
```
git merge excercise-general-001
```
Whenever the command `dotnet test` passes, you can consider the excercise passed and merge the next excercise.

The list of assignments will be here at the end of the README.md file.

## ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! You made it to the first excercise! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

### excercise-general-001
In this excercise you will need to make a test project. Do it by running the command:
```
dotnet new sln -n LinqTutorial &&
  dotnet new mstest -o LinqTutorial.Tests &&
  dotnet sln LinqTutorial.sln add LinqTutorial.Tests/
```

### excercise-enumerables-001
Your task is to implement `MyEnumerable` that is an implementor of `IEnumerable<int>`. It has a static method that is almost the same as `Enumerable.Range`, but `Enumerable.Range` takes two parameters: the start int, and the number of items to generate, but `MyEnumerable.Range` takes a start int and an end in exclusive.


Check your solution with running the following command (after making sure its safe of course). It will also print what to do for the next excercise:
```
chmod 755 check.sh && ./check.sh
```
